# Insertion-Sort
# This code takes an int array as an input and lets you perform insertion sort.
#  It divides the array into small array and then inserts an element in the correct location of that array and repeats the process until the whole array is sorted.
# Worst case: O(N^2)
# Best case: O(N)
# works best with small arrays
